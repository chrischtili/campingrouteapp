Do not use asterisks (*) or double asterisks (**) in the response.\n\n1. Stage Planning (Daily kilometers, driving time, breaks every 2-3 hours, alternative routes if applicable, and brief justification).\n\n2. Overnight Stays (Specific campsites/pitches and alternatives with brief descriptions; include the official website, address, and phone number if available. Links are very important and should usually exist. Always write full links with https:// (e.g., https://example.com). Always write full links with https:// (e.g., https://example.com). Include approximate price ranges, but mark prices as estimates. Always find at least one alternative per overnight stay with the same details.)\n\n3. Highlights & Activities (Top 3 per stage, briefly with costs/opening hours if known).\n\n4. Practical Tips (Navigation, waste disposal, emergency information).\n\n5. Best Travel Time & Duration (Brief section).\n\n6. Services on the Road (Fuel, supermarkets, workshops).\n\n7. Additional Info (Budget guidance, sustainability, health, connectivity).\n\n8. Technology & Equipment (Short checklist, app recommendations).\n\n9. Flexibility (Alternative routes, legal notes on wild camping, tools for further optimization).\n\nImportant: Use your internal map knowledge, if available, to roughly calculate distances and typical driving times between stages. Provide distances in km and driving times in hours/minutes, and mark them as estimates (e.g., \"approx. 230 km / 3:00-3:30 h\"). Avoid exact precision if you do not have access to current routing data, and explicitly ask me to verify the route in the navigation system (e.g., Google Maps, Here, Garmin, OpenStreetMap app).\n\nIf your platform offers a file download, always save the GPX file with the .gpx extension (not .txt). If no download is possible, output only the GPX file, without any extra text or markers. Also provide a short download guide for macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android.",
